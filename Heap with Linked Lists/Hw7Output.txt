Preliminary tests complete.
Now performing 20 detailed tests...
Allocate 5 200 byte blocks and then try to allocate 1 byte - should fail:
Passed Test 1 - Can't create a block of size 1
Free a block not allocated and try to allocate more memory - should fail:
Passed Test 2 - Nothing freed.  Can't create a block of size 1
Free all memory then allocate 1000 bytes to 1 pointer:
Passed Test 3 - All memory freed followed by 1000 byte allocation.
Just freed block 1 (entire heap should now be available).
Adding a 201 size block???
Passed Test 4 - Allocated 201 bytes.
Adding a 100 size block???
Passed Test 5 - Just created the block of size 100
Freeing block #2:
Freeing block #1:
Allocate 5 200 byte blocks:
Freeing block 3 and try to allocate 50 bytes...
Passed Test 6 - Just allocated 50 bytes.
Freeing block 2 and try to allocate 50 bytes...
Passed Test 7 - Just allocated 50 bytes.
Heap is fragmented with 7 blocks, 2 non-contiguous free blocks of 150 bytes each.
[  200   |50| 150  |50| 150  |  200   |  200   ]
              Free      Free
Now freeing block 7 and allocating a block of 151 bytes...
Passed Test 8 - Just allocated 151 bytes in block 7 with a free block 8.
Heap is fragmented with 8 blocks, 349 bytes total in three non-contiguous free blocks
of 150, 150, & 49 bytes respectively.
[  200   |50| 150  |50| 150  |  200   | 151  |49]
              Free      Free                  Free
Trying to allocate a block of 325 bytes (should fail)...
Passed Test 9 - Could not allocate 325 bytes.
Freeing block 4 which should contain 50 bytes with 150 bytes in both neighboring
blocks.  All 3 blocks should coalesce into a single free block of 350 bytes.
[  200   |50|      350       |  200   | 151  |49]
                   Free                       Free
Now allocate a block of 325 bytes (should succeed)...
[  200   |50|     325     |25|  200   | 151  |49]
                           Free               Free
Passed Test 10 - Just allocated 325 bytes.
Try to allocate a block of 40 bytes (should succeed)...
[  200   |50|     325     |25|  200   | 151  |40|9]
                           Free                  Free
Passed Test 11 - Just allocated 40 bytes.
Try to allocate a block of 26 bytes (should fail)...
Passed Test 12 - Could not allocate 26 bytes.
Try to allocate a block of 25 bytes (should succeed)...
[  200   |50|     325     |25|  200   | 151  |40|9]
                                                 Free
Passed Test 13 - Just allocated 25 bytes.
Try to allocate a block of 49 bytes (should fail)...
Passed Test 14 - Could not allocate 49 bytes.
Free block 7 and try to allocate a block of 49 bytes (should succeed)...
[  200   |50|     325     |25|  200   | 151  |49]
Passed Test 15 - Just allocated 49 bytes.
Heap should be full.  Let's check by trying to allocate 1 byte (should fail)...
Passed Test 16 - Could not allocate 1 byte.  Heap is full!
Check coalescing.  Free last 2 blocks and try to allocate 201 bytes (should fail)...
[  200   |50|     325     |25|  200   |  200   ]
                                         Free
Passed Test 17 - Could not allocate 201 bytes after coalescing last 2 blocks.
Try to allocate 200 bytes (should succeed)...
[  200   |50|     325     |25|  200   |  200   ]
Passed Test 18 - Allocated 200 bytes after coalescing last 2 blocks.
Check coalescing block 2 and block 1 and try to allocate 251 bytes (should fail)...
[  250   |     325     |25|  200   |  200   ]
   Free
